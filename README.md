## Other comments
Since the data provided was in the form of csv files, I assumed that it was expected that the solution submitted should utilise them. However, if this were not the case, I would likely have chosen to use SQL databse instead. With this in mind, I have not approached the task with an eye for extensibility. I took an approach of attempting to fulfil the exact requirements stated as quickly as possible using csv files. I have also been very minimal in the design of the report layout.
